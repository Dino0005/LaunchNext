MacOS Tahoe removed launchpad,and it's so hard to use, it's doesn't use your Bio GPU, please apple, at least give people an option to switch back. Before that, here is LaunchNext

*Built upon [LaunchNext](https://github.com/ggkevinnnn/LaunchNext) by ggkevinnnn - huge thanks to the original project! I hope this enhanced version can be merged back to the original repository*

*Since the original project has no license specified, the original author is welcome to contact me regarding licensing or any concerns.*

### What LaunchNext Delivers
- ‚úÖ **One-click import from old system Launchpad** - directly reads your native Launchpad SQLite database (`/private$(getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR)com.apple.dock.launchpad/db/db`) to perfectly recreate your existing folders, app positions, and layout
- ‚úÖ **Classic Launchpad experience** - works exactly like the beloved original interface
- ‚úÖ **Hide icon labels** - clean, minimalist view when you don't need app names
- ‚úÖ **Custom icon sizes** - adjust icon dimensions to fit your preferences
- ‚úÖ **Smart folder management** - create and organize folders just like before
- ‚úÖ **Instant search and keyboard navigation** - find apps quickly
